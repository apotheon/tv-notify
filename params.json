{"name":"Tv-notify","body":"## TV Notify\r\n\r\nTV Notify notifies you about your favorite upcomming programs. It queries\r\na provider of your choice for the upcomming listings in your area.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the supported providers are.\r\n\r\n  - LocateTV\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe only real requirement is Ruby 1.9.1 or higher. To install the required\r\ngems, just run the `bundle` command. The following gems are installed.\r\n\r\n  - Libnotify\r\n  - Nokogiri\r\n  - Chronic\r\n\r\nYou should **not** install these gems manually. There are some other gems\r\nthat need to be installed for them to work. And some gems are installed\r\nfrom their Git source.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTV Notify uses a YAML configuration file. An example configuration file is\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    # The TV Show\r\n    show: How I Met Your Mother\r\n\r\n    # The TV Provider (See above list.)\r\n    provider: locatetv\r\n\r\n    # The time within the show to display the notifications (in seconds.)\r\n    time: 600\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a configuration file **is required** for TV Notify. One you have,\r\nyour configuration file you can run TV Notify as follows.\r\n\r\n    ruby /path/to/tv-notify.rb /path/to/config.yml\r\n\r\n## Contributing A Provider\r\n\r\nIf LocateTV does not work for you, you can write your own provider and tie\r\nit in. Your provider should be similar to the LocateTV provider, located in\r\n`lib/tv-notify/locatetv.rb`.\r\n\r\nWhile your provider does not need to implement the same methods as the\r\nLocateTV provider; it does need to implement the `get_show_listings` method.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your provider, stop. Don't do anything else and open a pull\r\nrequest with the TV Notify repository. We will configure the rest. But thanks\r\nfor making a provider for us.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nYou can contact me [through Github][1] or by email. Thanks for using TV Notify!\r\n\r\n  Bryan Dunsmore  \r\n  dunsmoreb@gmail.com\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/dunsmoreb\r\n","tagline":"A TV notification program.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
